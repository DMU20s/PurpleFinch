# How to contribute

First of all: i'm humbled and honored that anyone would be interested in contributing to this. The fact that you're reading this, makes me even happier. It shows you give a crap.  

If you have any questions regarding contributions, feel free to catch us on our Slack server. Here's an invite for ya: https://join.slack.com/t/pfphilby/shared_invite/zt-hshsqw8n-EnKh659Zz2xC1gZ~H3Eq0w
It'll probably be expired by the time you read this, but feel free to message one of us for a fresh invite.  

Second: please be patient with us. Both [Emil "0xcyber-sketch" Langager Larsen](https://github.com/0xcyber-sketch) and [myself](https://github.com/Veticus) are both fulltime CompSci students.   
So there will be some delays... everywhere... all the time.

We do, however appreciate any input, even if it's just a kindly worded suggestion.



## Testing
Emberassingly, we haven't implemented any structured testing as of now. This is, however, a semi-high priority.


## Coding conventions
Most of this project is written in Python3. So we'd love it, if your code is at least somewhat PEP8 compliant.  
(Except for the indentation thing. We do tabs, but feel free to use spaces, if you're more comfortable with that.)

With regards to versioning, we're aiming to get into the habbit of following SemVer to the best of our abilities.  

The structure of the project, and it's related projects, is still extrodinarily chaotic, because we're still in the process of prototyping and trying our ideas.  
There are some rough guidelines outlined in the WIKI, but some of that might change, as we learn new stuff along the way.

## Contributing
As mentioned, we appreciate any contribution. May they be in the form of issues or PRs.  
Due to the current chaotic nature of this project, we're keeping these guides rather "loosey goosey". We only ask that you avoid making your contributions "unreadable".
