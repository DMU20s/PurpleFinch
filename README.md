# PurpleFinch
"Where the magic happens" in the PurpleFinch universe.
This is the "core" part, that receives, manages and makes data available.

# Ok, but like.. wtf is PurpleFinch ?
The PurpleFinch (pf) project aims to collect data and turn it into deliverable information and decisions.  

The "sources" gather info, and submit it over MQTT.  

pfcore will then validate the data and store it... somehow  

The "frontends" will then request the data in processed formats, or requests decisions to be made, based on the data.

## Note
PurpleFinch is a side project, for the little spare time we have.  
Meaning this is gonna be slooooooooow. And there will be plenty of puns and easter-eggs.  
Check WIKI for protocol drafts...
